site makes a connection between the users and a link to join the site (link to login 
and registration process).
2. Users have to do the registration process to be able to enter the website.
3. In the register form, the user will be asked to fill his own information (first name, 
last name, email, password, and his native language), of course there is a 
validation on each field (minimum length or valid input for email), and the email 
must be a unique one.
4. In the login form, if the user type in an email that is not related to the data base, 
he will be asked to enter an existing one, same for the password, it must be 
matched the one on the database.
5. When the user enters the website, he will be redirected to the main page, which 
includes the current languages. the user can choose a certain language and when 
he enters its page, he will find users and start chat with them
